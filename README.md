# PersonalWebsite

Ideas:
- done in Coalesce w vuetify, deployed on Azure
- list of projects (make them entities so you can add/edit)
- make it super pretty (practice CSS on it + Vuetify cool tricks)
- Key vault, blob storage, etc.
- make it about presentation mostly. Implement these features, but focus more on presentation. Your other projects are for displaying your knowledge about key vault, blob storage, deployment, etc.
- make a cool css animation to showcase projects
- that's all for now :)
